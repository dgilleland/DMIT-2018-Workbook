## West Wind Wholesale

The **ASP.NET Core *Web Application*** solution in this lesson illustrates the limitations of building a website around basic CRUD behaviours.

Imagine that we've received an email from one of our customers asking to place an order.

> Hi Nancy. Please generate an order for the following items.
>
> - 20 - *Gorgonzola Telino*
> - 15 - *Inlagd Sill*
> - 8 - *Gustaf's Knäckebröd*
> - 18 - *Camembert Pierrot*
>
> I don't have an exact due date yet. I'm opening another restaurant in the city, and I'll give you the due date and the shipping address to use later today.
>
> Thanks!

### Tasks

1. Attempt to generate the customer order using the information given and the web application's CRUD forms.
1. Imagine that we would want the ability to **place customer orders** on a single web form. What would that look like? Sketch out what you think should be placed on the page.
