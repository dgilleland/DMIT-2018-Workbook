# Backlog

The folders here represent distinct demos and practice materials as referenced in class. Your instructor will give you directions on moving these folders to the `src/` folder as needed.

**Do not move these backlog items until you are told to do so** by your instructor; this will help you to avoid confusion about what is being done in each class. Your instructor may augment these backlog items with additional folders throughout the course by giving you *pull requests* via GitHub.
